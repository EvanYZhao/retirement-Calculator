 # Front-end Goals
 - React :white_check_mark:
 - Create a user-friendly interface for grabbing inputs and outputs

 # Back-end Goals
 - Python (Flask) :white_check_mark:
 - Process User Data

 # Both
 - Connect Flask to React using proxy :white_check_mark:

 # CURRENT ISSUES
 - Problem 1: Starting up React by itself makes it impossible to fetch data from the Flask backend unless they're both activated at the same time.
- Fix 1: Change the "react-start" script in package.json to run flask simultaneously with React
